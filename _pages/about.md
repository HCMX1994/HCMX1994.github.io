I received my BEng degree and MEng degree with honours from Xidian University (Xi’an, China). I completed my PhD at the School of Engineering, University of Kent (Canterbury, UK). My research spans various areas, including multiband arrays, Sub-THz antennas, transmit arrays, filtering and electromagnetic transparent antennas, RF systems, and MIMO antenna technologies.

In the academic community, I serve as a reviewer for several prestigious international journals, including [IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=19), [IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8), [IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7727), [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/), [IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation](https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/iet-map), [Journal of Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves](https://link.springer.com/journal/10762), [AEUE-International Journal of Electronics and Communications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/aeu-international-journal-of-electronics-and-communications), [Wireless Personal Communications](https://link.springer.com/journal/11277), and [ETRI Journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/22337326). I also contribute as an International Program Committee Member for the [European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (2025)](https://www.eucap2025.org/), the [International Conference on AI in Healthcare (2024)](https://aiih.cc/), and the [United Conference on Millimetre Waves and Terahertz Technologies (2024)](https://www.ucmmt2024.org/).

Outside of work, I love to explore the world, record my experiences, and enjoy running and hiking.
