I received my BEng degree and MEng degree with honours from Xidian University (Xiâ€™an, China). I completed my PhD at the School of Engineering, University of Kent (Canterbury, UK). My research spans various areas, including multiband arrays, Sub-THz antennas, transmit arrays, filtering and electromagnetic transparent antennas, RF systems, and MIMO antenna technologies.

In the academic community, I serve as a reviewer for several prestigious international journals, including IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, Nature Scientific Reports, IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation, Journal of Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves, AEUE-International Journal of Electronics and Communications, Wireless Personal Communications, and the ETRI Journal. I also contribute as an International Program Committee Member for the European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (2025), the International Conference on AI in Healthcare (2024), and the United Conference on Millimetre Waves and Terahertz Technologies (2024).

Outside of work, I love to explore the world, record my experiences, and enjoy running and hiking.
