I am excited to share that my master’s thesis was recently recognized with the Outstanding Master’s Thesis Award by Xidian University, selected from the top 2% of the 2,998 theses submitted that year. This award is a prestigious recognition of the research efforts and contributions I made during my time at Xidian, a place that has deeply shaped my academic and professional growth.
