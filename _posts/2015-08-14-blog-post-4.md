I am thrilled to announce that I have been awarded the 2nd Prize of the Best Student Paper Award at the 2022 IEEE International Workshop on Antenna Technology (iWAT), which took place in Dublin! This is an incredible honour, and I am truly humbled to have my work recognized on such an esteemed international platform.

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Professor Steven Gao, Dr. Benito Sanz, and my industrial supervisors for their incredible guidance and support throughout my PhD journey.
