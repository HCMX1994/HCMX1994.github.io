I am incredibly excited to share that I have been awarded a full scholarship to pursue my PhD at the University of Kent under the esteemed supervision of Professor Steven Gao. This marks a major milestone in my academic journey, and Iâ€™m beyond grateful for the opportunity to work at such a prestigious institution alongside one of the leading experts in the field of antenna and RF technologies.
