I am beyond thrilled to share that my paper, titled "A Mutual-Coupling-Suppressed Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Base Station Antenna Using Multiple Folded-Dipole Antenna", has been recognized as one of the [23 Most Read Articles](https://ieeeaps.org/ieee-tap/for-readers/23-articles-that-captured-our-readers-attention) for 2023 in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation (IEEE TAP)! This is an incredible honour, and Iâ€™m truly humbled by the recognition my work has received in the field of antennas and propagation.
