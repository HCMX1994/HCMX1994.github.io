A dual-polarized antenna with multimode resonance and high selectivity is proposed in this article to cover the 5G sub-6 GHz bands. The proposed antenna achieves dual wide impedance bandwidth characteristics by incorporating a dual mode coupled patch and four planar coupled strips around the driven patch. Through the four resonant modes of these structures, the antenna effectively covers the two desired frequency bands. Moreover, the electric/magnetic coupling between the driven patch, dual mode coupled patch, and planar coupled strips enables the creation of three radiation nulls that suppress unwanted radiation. To further improve the out-of-band rejection level and half power beamwidth (HPBW), four shorted strips are introduced around the radiator. The introduction of these strips results in a fourth radiation null at higher out-of-band frequencies and expands the antenna’s HPBW from 52° to 62°. To demonstrate the feasibility of the design, both the proposed antenna and its array were manufactured and tested. Measured results show that the filtering element was able to operate within frequency bands of 3.24–3.83 GHz (16.7%) and 4.74–5.30 GHz (11.2%) with a reference of |Sdd11|<−14 dB. The input ports exhibited a high level of isolation, measuring 40 dB. Furthermore, the four radiation nulls proved effective in suppressing out-of-band radiation.
