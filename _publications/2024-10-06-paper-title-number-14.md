This paper introduces a dual-band array antenna designed for base stations. To mitigate the influence of lower band antenna on the radiation patterns of higher band elements, we introduce a broadband electromagnetic transparent antenna incorporating vertically printed frequency selective surface elements. The antenna not only boasts a broad impedance bandwidth but also achieves electromagnetic transparency across a wide frequency band. The proposed lower band antenna obtains a wide impedance bandwidth of 36.9% and exhibits favorable electromagnetic transparency characteristics within the n77 band.
