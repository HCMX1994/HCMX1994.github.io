A dual-polarized filtering antenna with steep cut-off and compact size is developed for base-station applications. In this design, four controllable radiation nulls are obtained by utilizing split rings, slotted T-shaped branches, a single-stub tuner, and a parasitic loop. Split rings are first used as the dipole arms to obtain the first radiation null at upper out-of-band. Four T-shaped branches working as DGS are printed under the crossed dipoles to achieve the second radiation null. The connected outer conductors of the differential feed structure acting as a single-stub tuner can provide the third radiation null to further enhance the upper band rejection. Finally, a parasitic loop is incorporated around the split rings, and the out-of-band rejection of the lower band is further enhanced by the fourth radiation null. More importantly, the impedance bandwidth of the antenna can be expended with two newly introduced resonant modes. As a result, a compact filtering antenna with a wide operational bandwidth of 1.7–3.01 GHz (56%) is realized for Sdd11<−15 dB with the isolation higher than 38 dB. The out-of-band suppression is higher than 18.4 dB in 3.1–4.5 GHz and more than 47 dB in 0.8–1.1 GHz.
