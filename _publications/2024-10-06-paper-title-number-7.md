An interleaved shared-aperture dual-band dual-polarized base station array antenna is proposed in this article. The lower-band (LB) element is realized by using a multiple folded-dipole antenna (MFDA) and four parasitic loops. To interpret the working principle of the MFDA, a double folded-dipole antenna (DFDA) is firstly analyzed by using the transmission line (TL) model. Then, by combining two bended DFDAs and introducing four parasitic loops, a low cross-band scattering LB element with a high out-of-band rejection level of 16 dB is obtained to cover 2.3–2.7 GHz. The higher-band (HB) element with a wide impedance bandwidth of 42.5% (3.0–4.6 GHz), a high roll-off rate (RoR) of 249.2 dB/GHz, and a high out-of-band rejection level of 17 dB is obtained by introducing a meander line loop (MLL), a rectangular loop (RL), and V-shaped strips (VSS) near the dipole arms. By combining the proposed low-scattering low-pass LB element and the high- RoR high-pass HB element, a novel interleaved shared-aperture dual-band dual-polarized array antenna with a small frequency ratio of 1.46 and a high cross-band isolation level of 25 dB is realized. Due to the low-scattering characteristic and filtering response of the LB element, the radiation patterns of the wideband HB sub-arrays are almost unaffected.
