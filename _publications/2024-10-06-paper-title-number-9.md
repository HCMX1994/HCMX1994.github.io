This study introduces a wideband and compact filtering antenna with dual-polarization for 5G base station usage. The proposed design, which combines meander lines and parasitic grid structures, achieves a broad operating bandwidth and an excellent gain suppression level in the unwanted 2/3/4G band. To verify the design concept, a phototype of the design was fabricated and tested. According to the test results, the proposed design can cover 3.16 GHz to 4.75 GHz. The isolation between the two ports exceeds 30 dB in the target n77 band (3.3-4.2 GHz). Additionally, the gain rejection level is higher than 13 dB in 1.7-2.7 GHz.
